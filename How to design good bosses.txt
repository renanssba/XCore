BOSS DESIGN THEORY

------

Can be one of 3 roles:
-test of skill
-narrative device
-change of pace

------

Things to consider:
-battle difficulty
-battle length
-MOST IMPORTANT: engagement (easy bosses can be fun, if they draw you in with a fun scenario)

------

1. mechanics
2. threat
3. theming
4. a twist(?)

------

Example of Good Boss Fight (A Hat in Time)

-Callbacks to previous scenes
-battle stops midway and the boss tries to negotiate
-great pacing (the battle stopping is good to have a breather in the middle of the frenzy)

------

Desirable elements:

-microgoals
-something to learn / change gameplay pattern
-attacks get stronger/more intense
-battle of endurance
-strategic
-challenge your preparation and tactical skills
-should be challenging, but fair
-attacks should be telegraphed or part of a pattern
-avoid padding boss health
-should (probably) be intimidating
-test what the player has learned
-should have a nice reward
-great bosses are fresh and unique
-consider using multiple phases
-should be fun
