Hey Corina!

This folder here is for the assets we did for a BIG Festival in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in 2019.

These cards have each contain half of a phrase. The phrases are lyrics for romantic songs or related to pop culture couples or memes.


What we did in BIG Festival: each person that got to our booth and played a little bit of Fertiliel got one of these cards. After that, the person could find another one in the event who had the other half of their phrase. If the two people got in the booth with matching cards, we gave them buttons, stickers, etc.

The result was that many people who played the game (and got a card) brought some friends or family to play it as well, and lots of people got around our booth waiting for other people to play and see if they had matching cards.
One girl in special brought around 8 people to play the game so she could have a pair of matching cards and get the rewards :)



I'll translate the lyrics below, if you're curious:

1A-1B
Let me tell I love you - Let me think about you.
(Brazilian song "Amor I love You" from Marisa Monte)

2A-2B
"Together and - shallow now".
(Brazilian meme about Lady Gaga's song Shallow)

3A-3B
"Listen to your heart - when it's calling for you."
(Listen to your heart, from Roxette)

4A-4B
"Your smile is so resplendent - it made my heart happy."
(Brazilian opening for Dragon Ball Z)

5A-5B
"I just want to and I hope to - have you by my side forever."
(Brazilian opening for Card Captor Sakura)


Cheers, Renan
