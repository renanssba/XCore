SEASONS OF LOVE SHADER PACK 0.1A

These are modifications of Unity standard shaders and Taichi's shaders from the Asset Store with the simple objective of making our characters look nicer.

Features:

1- Outlines, with the option of scaling the outlines  in relation to POV or not.
(Unity's default toon shader doesn't scale the outlines to the camera distance, which makes some models look horrible from a distance.)
2 - Models can cast shadows.
3 - Models can receive shadows, although this is not recommended. (Shadows are still full-black, not consistent with an anime look. I'll look into that one day.)

4 - You can use vertex painting to control lighting to some degree.
Red component adds lighting. 100% red means always  lit. Use this on the eyes and other elements that must be always lit.
Green component multiplies lighting. You can use this to control how much lighting is needed to fully iluminate a face. Still not working properly, but it's good enough.
Blue component controls outline width. Working 100%.

(If the model is painted white, all options apply. Please note that a white model has 100% red, thus is always fully lit.)

General guidelines:

1 - For white-ish skin tones, pick shadow colors closer to red.
2 - For outline colors, pick slightly darker tones from the main texture.
3 - Paint the whole model cyan (100% green, 100% blue) for a good default experience. Paint eyes red for a more convincing anime look. Tune as needed.
4 - Have fun!
